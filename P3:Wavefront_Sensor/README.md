# Wavefront Sensor Experiment 
I conducted a lab focused on wavefront sensing, which aimed to investigate the principles and applications of wavefront sensors in optical systems. The goal of the lab was to understand how these sensors work, measure wavefront distortions, and analyze the data to assess the accuracy of the measurements. Using a wavefront sensor, an optical system, and a light source, I was able to collect wavefront data under different configurations. The results were processed using specialized software, which allowed for a comparison between the measured wavefront distortions and theoretical predictions. This analysis showed how accurately the sensor was able to detect distortions, and any discrepancies were considered in terms of potential sources of error. The lab demonstrated the capabilities and limitations of wavefront sensors, providing valuable insights into their use for optical system optimization. The data collected was generally consistent with theoretical expectations, but some small discrepancies were observed, likely due to experimental factors. Overall, this lab contributed important knowledge to the field of wavefront sensing.
